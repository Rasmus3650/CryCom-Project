Implementation of GSW.

Implementation for both Python and Go, further info is in their respective folder as `README.md`

## Python
The main file for this project is the `gsw_scheme.py`, this is where all the functionality of the GSW scheme has been implemented.

The `test_gsw_scheme.py`is to verify the properties of the scheme, and was used as a guideline for implementation.

The `experiments.py` file contains all the code used to generate the data and the plots for the experiments section of the report

There are 2 files `yao.py` and `blood_type.py`, these files contain the MPC protocol to securely evaluate circuits using GSW.
